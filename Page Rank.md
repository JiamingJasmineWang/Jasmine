# Page Rank Algorithm
It is the first algorithm used by Google. When we visit the website as a random web surfer, we start from one page and finally visit all the pages mutiple times, assuming we have all the links on each page. We are going to rank them from frequently visit to randomly visit.
## Ranking
$P_{ij}\ = 1/deg(j) if node j links $
